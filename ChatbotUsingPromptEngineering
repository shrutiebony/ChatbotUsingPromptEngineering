1. Business Understanding: The first step in the CRISP-DM framework is to comprehend the objectives of the analysis. In this case, the goal is to predict income levels based on various demographic and economic features. Understanding the context and significance of house price prediction will guide our analysis and model development.

2. Data Understanding: Next, we will acquire the dataset and perform an initial examination. This includes loading the data, checking for missing values, and understanding the data types of each feature. We will also generate summary statistics to get a sense of the distribution of the data.

3. Data Preparation: In this phase, we will clean the data by addressing any missing values and correcting inconsistencies. This may involve imputing missing values, removing duplicates, and converting categorical variables into numerical formats through encoding techniques.

At this point, we have completed the initial steps of the CRISP-DM methodology, focusing on business understanding, data understanding, and data preparation. The next steps will involve detailed exploratory data analysis, including data visualization and feature selection.
