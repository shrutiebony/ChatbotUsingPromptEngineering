## Introduction

This project involves building an AI chatbot utilizing ChatGPT's code interpreter, Python, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib for visualization. Following the CRISP-DM framework (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), we will create a machine learning model to automatically predict house prices. This README provides an overview of the six phases of CRISP-DM as applied to this project.

## CRISP-DM Framework Phases

### 1. Business Understanding

The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model that can predict house prices accurately. The AI chatbot will assist users by processing data and making predictions based on trained models.

### 2. Data Understanding

In this phase, we explore the dataset to understand its structure, contents, and potential challenges.

#### Key Objectives:

Data Collection: Import and examine the dataset to familiarize ourselves with its structure.

Descriptive Statistics: Analyze the dataset's size, distribution, and identify any missing values.

Visualization: Generate samples to uncover patterns and challenges.

Quality Assessment: Detect and address missing, corrupt, or irrelevant data that could hinder model performance.

### 3. Data Preparation

Prepare the dataset for model training by performing essential pre-processing steps.

#### Key Steps:

Normalization: Scale features to a range between 0 and 1 to improve model performance.

Reshaping: Ensure the data is appropriately scaled, typically using a standard or normal scaler.

Train-Test Split: Divide the dataset into training and validation sets as required.

Data Augmentation (Optional): Use techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to artificially expand the dataset and enhance generalization.

### 4. Model Training

Using TensorFlow, we will train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model optimized for the dataset.

#### Approach:

Define the CNN architecture.

Train the model using prepared data.

Optimize hyperparameters to enhance performance.

### 5. Model Evaluation

Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and generalization ability on unseen data to ensure it meets project objectives.

#### Key Metrics:

Accuracy: Measure the percentage of correctly predicted house prices.

Confusion Matrix: Analyze classification results and identify areas of confusion.

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Assess false positives and negatives for deeper insights.

Loss and Accuracy Curves: Visualize model performance across training epochs.

### 6. Model Deployment

Deploy the trained model into a production environment for real-time or batch predictions.

#### Common Deployment Options:

Web Service: Serve the model via a REST API to handle input data and return predictions.

Mobile/Embedded Application: Export the model to formats like TensorFlow Lite for compatibility with mobile and edge devices.

Cloud Deployment: Use scalable cloud services such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for deployment.

## Tools and Technologies

ChatGPT Code Interpreter: For AI-assisted coding and testing.
